# Counting-number-of-faces-using-Python
Using python language and libraries we'll count the number of humans in a live video.

In this project we are making use of Digital image processing for detecting and counting the number of 
human faces that are detected in the live video frame. For each detected human face we display a square 
box along with the count on the top of the box.For the detection of human face here we used python 
language in the spyder IDE and libraries like OpenCV,numpy and dlib.

Future scope:
Furtherly we can extend this project to limit the crowd density in the interested areas. Let say if we 
can connect the buzzer to this project after the particular number of faces are captured, we can 
activate the buzzer alert to stop the people from entering the area.
In the other way instead of giving particular number as input,we can calculate density and can 
activate the buzzer and stop the people from entering the area.
